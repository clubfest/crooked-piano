## Video
Let me show you a new way to experience
  the music you love

---- to game page

I was watching a movie when
  a captivating tune started
  I wanted to play along
  
With the Crooked Piano,
  I can enjoy the music by 
  playing along like this

---- click the first part
  
Or if you like to type,
  you can just type along
  with the yellow key indicator

---- type the second part

Without any muscial background,
  I can still play the melody effortlessly
---- click next
  
To make the song sound better,
  we can add some colorful bass notes
  
But playing the Crooked Piano
  with 2 hands is not easy
  
So for beginners,
  the Crooked Piano will help you
  by playing the left hand notes

Now, I just need to click as
  I did before
  
----- click the first part
 
but with a more colorful sound

Or if you like to type,
  you can just type along
  with the yellow key indicator
  
---- scoring
This is how you can play and enjoy
  a beautiful song without
  any musical knowledge
