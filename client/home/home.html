    <p id='intro'>
      Listening to music takes us to another world, where we can fly over majestic mountains, wind thru forests of uncertainties, and land safely on a peaceful lake. Today, I endow you with the power to play the music, so that you can hug the clouds, glaze the leaves and refresh in the cool mountain water.
