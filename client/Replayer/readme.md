Replayer
========
To play a certain song in Songs, use `{{> replayer}}` and put in the song data via Session.set('song').

## Detail

* We play the song by triggering keyboardDown.
* We annotate the note to distinguish keyboardDown coming from the replayer 

## TODO

* Update the note to play in a different channel
