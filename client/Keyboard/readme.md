keyboard
========

If we need only 1 keyboard, then we use simpleKeyboard.


## How are events connected?
```
    key      touch    mouse
     +         +        +
     |         |        |
     |         |        |
     v         v        v
           keyboard
           +       +
           |       |
           |       |
           v       v
